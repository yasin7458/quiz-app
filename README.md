# 📖 About The Project

The **JavaScript Quiz Application** is a beginner-friendly frontend project designed to improve JavaScript programming skills through practical implementation.

The application dynamically displays quiz questions stored inside a JavaScript array of objects. Every question includes four multiple-choice options, and users can select an answer before submitting it.

Each question has a **60-second timer**. If the user fails to answer within the allotted time, the application automatically moves to the next question and records it as a **Time Up Question**.

After completing all questions, the application calculates the user's score, percentage, number of correct answers, wrong answers, timed-out questions, and finally displays whether the user has **Passed** or **Failed**.

The project is developed completely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** without using any external libraries or frameworks.

# 🚀 Functionalities

## ❓ Dynamic Question Rendering

All quiz questions are stored inside a JavaScript array.

Whenever the current question changes, JavaScript dynamically generates the question and its four options using **Template Literals** and **innerHTML**.

This approach avoids writing static HTML for every question and makes the application scalable.

---

## ⏱️ Question Timer

Every question starts with a **60-second countdown timer**.

The timer updates every second using **setInterval()**.

If the timer reaches zero before the user submits an answer:

✔ The timer stops.

✔ The question is added to the **Time Up Questions** list.

✔ The next question automatically appears.

---

➡️ **Continue with Part 2** (Timer Logic, Previous/Next Buttons, Submit Logic, Result Screen, UI Preview, JavaScript Topics, CSS Concepts, HTML Elements...).

## ⏭️ Next Question

The **Next** button allows users to move to the next question without submitting an answer.

### Working

✔ User clicks the **Next** button.

✔ The current timer stops.

✔ The current question index increases.

✔ The next question is displayed.

✔ A fresh **60-second timer** starts for the next question.

---

## ⏮️ Previous Question

The application also allows users to return to previously visited questions.

A **Back Stack** is maintained using a JavaScript array.

### Working

✔ Every time the user moves to the next question, the current index is stored.

✔ Clicking the **Previous** button retrieves the last visited question.

✔ The timer restarts for the displayed question.

✔ The Previous button automatically becomes disabled when there are no previous questions available.

---

## ✅ Submit Answer

Users must select one option before submitting.

### Working

✔ User selects an answer.

✔ Clicks the **Submit** button.

✔ JavaScript checks whether an option has been selected.

✔ If no option is selected, an alert message is displayed.

✔ If an option is selected:

- The answer is compared with the correct answer.
- The score is updated if the answer is correct.
- The timer stops.
- The next question is displayed automatically.

---

## ⌛ Time Up Questions

Every question has an individual countdown timer.

If the timer reaches **0 seconds**:

✔ The timer stops.

✔ The current question is stored inside the **Time Up Questions** array.

✔ An alert informs the user that the time has expired.

✔ The application automatically moves to the next question.

---

## 📊 Final Result

After all questions have been completed, the application displays a complete performance summary.

The result screen includes:

- 📋 Total Questions
- ✅ Correct Answers
- ❌ Wrong Answers
- ⌛ Time Up Questions
- 🎯 Final Score
- 📈 Percentage
- 🏆 Pass / Fail Result

A user scoring **40% or above** is marked as **PASS**, otherwise **FAIL**.
